# How to generate your own book

## Installation

First, fork this repo.

Next, please install the requirements:

```bash
pip install --user -r requirements.txt 
```

Then run the build process:

```bash
cd build_pdf
mkdocs build -f path_to_config_file.yml
```

or launch the bash script to build everything:

```bash
bash build_all.sh
```

The book is manually generated by running either `mkdocs` or `build_all` command. 
On the other hand, github actions will also automatically generate the pdfs defined in build. 
Check **Actions** in github, open the latest successful build, click on **Upload PDF artifacts** and click the link to download.

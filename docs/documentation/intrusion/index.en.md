# About Redborder Intrusion

**Redborder Intrusion** is a **Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS)** designed to offer a flexible and powerful approach to deploying and managing intrusion detection and prevention systems.

This solution includes advanced software enhancements over a standard Snort probe, positioning **Redborder Intrusion** among the fastest options available.

Intrusion probes are highly adaptable and compatible with multiple rule/signature feeds, allowing users to configure the most suitable set of security rules through our domain, user, and hierarchy system.

This NGIPS can be tailored to any network scenario, making it easy to define and modify network inspection segments as needed.

**Redborder Intrusion** offers key functionalities for streamlined, scalable, and effective IPS management:

- **Policy Control**: Integrates enterprise-grade policy management for Snort within an open-source framework, combining robust management with scalability.

- **Hierarchical Policies**: Redborder organizes devices in a hierarchy, enabling group-based policies that cascade down while preserving local autonomy across probes, segments, and networks.

- **Policy Workflow**: Redborder simplifies policy creation and application, with easy rule searching, categorization, and full change tracking.

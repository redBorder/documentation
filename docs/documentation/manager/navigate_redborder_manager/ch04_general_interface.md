# General Interface

Redborder has a structure that is repeated in all Redborder interfaces. Knowing these elements will help you navigate the web comfortably and easily. (1)

1. The image corresponds to a Redborder installation with Traffic, Intrusion, Vault, and Mobility Apps active. The structure will be the same for any Redborder installation, except for the available applications in the top menu bar and whether they are active or not.

Let's see these parts:

1. **Menu Bar**: Here you will find direct access to all sections of the Redborder platform. It is subdivided into two areas according to functionality:
  
    1. *Analytics Area (upper left corner)*: Here you will find all the data collected by the sensors displayed in different metrics and reports.
    - *Configuration Area (upper right corner)*: Configuration and management options for the Apps and Redborder.

- **Submenu**: Shows the available options depending on the section we are consulting. Here we can see the configured filters, change the view we are in (Raw, Tops, Compare, Unique), among other options.

- **Main Area**: This is the content area. In this zone, data is displayed in different metrics and graphs. We can hover over the graph to see detailed information at that moment, and we can also select an area of the graph to zoom in and then filter within that time range of the graph.

- **Summary**: Below the graph, you will find a summary with the information displayed in the metric, providing total values and the percentage of visible data.

- **Search Engine**: Allows you to quickly search for any feature in the data table with the attribute being queried. You only need to enter the IP (you can use a regular expression), sensor, client, etc. that you want to query.

- **Data Table**: Provides details of the information displayed in the metric. Additionally, different actions can be performed per row. These actions depend on the module we are in.

## Dashboards

Redborder Manager comes with a platform dashboard call Overview. It provides a general view of the sensors added to Redborder Manager, their location on the map, and the access points.

In the left sidebar, you can see some metrics related to Traffic and Mobility.

The option in the top menu includes a dropdown menu that provides access to the User Dashboards.

## Incidents

The Redborder NDR Incidents list helps you quickly detect, investigate, and respond to security events by showing the most essential information in one place.

With Redborder NDR Incidents, you can:

  - See a prioritized list of incidents ranked by priority.
  - Open each Incident to view a quick summary.
  - Dive into detailed information for a deeper understanding of the threat, enabling faster triage and response.

To view enriched incidents promoted to Redborder NDR, click on Incidents in the top menu.

## Traffic

The Redborder Traffic App is designed to visualize network data in real-time. It allows you to filter by various dimensions, such as IP addresses, ports, country codes, and more, providing essential insights into network activity.

In this section, you can view data exported from a Redborder Flowgate probe or directly from network traffic exported by a switch or router.

Supported export data formats include NetFlow and sFlow.

## Intrusion

The Redborder Intrusion App allows you to visualize data generated by the Redborder Intrusion Probe. This probe analyzes each packet passing through the network, comparing it to cybersecurity incident detection patterns.

In this section, you can view, filter, and investigate which security events and issues have emerged on the network.

## Monitor

The Redborder Monitor App enables visualization of information generated by hardware devices. It uses "monitors" that can be assigned to various sensors added to the platform.

To monitor these devices, the platform utilizes SNMP queries.

## Scanner

Redborder Scanner is one of the latest additions to the Redborder NDR platform Apps.

This App can detect vulnerabilities within devices on a network. 

Additionally, it allows you to schedule periodic scans. This App uses the [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) list of known vulnerabilities.

## Vault

The Redborder Vault App enables log visualization and search. Redborder Manager NDR allows the addition of Vault-type sensors, which are configured to send syslog data to the Manager.

Log events are normalized and enriched within Redborder Manager.

## Mobility

The Redborder Mobility App enables visualization of data generated by the movement of devices (visitors) within a WiFi network.

This section provides insights into which areas within a facility visitors have moved through and at what times.

## Reports

This section provides tools for generating detailed summaries and analyses of network activity, security events, and device performance within the Redborder platform. 

Here, you can create customized reports on various metrics, such as traffic patterns, intrusion attempts, and device movements.

Reports can be scheduled for automatic generation and delivery, providing regular insights to help monitor network health and security.

## Global Filter

Allows you to apply a general filter that will impact various dashboards, widgets, and Redborder Apps.

## Fast Search

Allows you to search across the different Redborder Apps, events, and sensors.

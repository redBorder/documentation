# Audits

This option shows a list of user activity (or users) recorded on the Redborder platform, ordered chronologically by default. The user can sort the table in ascending or descending order for each of the columns. The search box at the top can be used to filter the information you want to see. The columns shown in this table are as follows:

- **User**: user who performed the action
- **Resource**: element that has been created, modified, or deleted
- **Action**: action that has been carried out (creation, editing, deletion)
- **Message**: brief description of what has been audited
- **Timestamp**: date and time of the activity record

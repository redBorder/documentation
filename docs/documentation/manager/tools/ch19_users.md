# Users

Activation or modification of user data, service management, or creating new records is possible from the **User Configuration** interface.

To search for a specific user, enter their details in the search bar. You can also browse through the alphabetical list located at the top of the user list.

Users can only view sections of the platform (read-only mode) and cannot modify content (except for their own user profile). The only user with permissions to do this is the Superadministrator.

The main screen shows a list of active users on the Redborder platform, email addresses, *Top Domain* (the highest level the user has access to), the number of logins, IP, and the time of their last access.

By clicking the **Edit** button, the user can modify information and view a summary of their status and activity within the platform.

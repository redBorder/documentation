# Cluster Settings

The Cluster Settings option allows us to check the status and configuration of the cluster, and establish the cluster creation process during the Manager installation process.

You can modify these values by editing through the Unlock button. The information can be changed with the following parameters:

- Cluster status
- Historical Nodes
- Historical Rules

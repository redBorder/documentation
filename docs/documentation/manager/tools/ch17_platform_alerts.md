# Platform Alerts

Alerts are messages displayed to all users when they enter the web platform. This section is where platform alerts can be managed.

There are three levels for alerts: information, warning, and danger. Each level has its own color so that the alerts can be differentiated, and all are placed below the menu bar. In the following image, we have an example of a test alert.

If the user clicks on the alert message, it will not be displayed again until the user logs in again.

It is possible to delete the alert by clicking on the cross in the message. After that, the alert message will no longer be displayed.

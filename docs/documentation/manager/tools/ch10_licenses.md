# Licenses

Through this option, the user can check which nodes have expired licenses. Likewise, it is possible to upload a new license or request a new one.

At the top edge of the screen, the number of available licenses, the applications that can be used with these licenses, and the number of expired nodes are indicated. There is a list of expired nodes that need to renew their licenses in the center of the screen. There is also a list of available actions.

To upload a file with a new Redborder license, click on **Upload License**. To request a new license, click on **Request license**.

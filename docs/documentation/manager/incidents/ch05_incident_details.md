### Response

The response section displays a **playbook**, which is a structured guide for handling the incident. A playbook provides a systematic approach to incident response, ensuring that all necessary steps are followed in a consistent manner. There are different types of playbooks, which are defined by the type of incident. The playbook is divided by phases. Each phase can have different tasks to be performed, and each task has a description of it and a specific space for writing the comments of response process. Phases and tasks are supposed to be executed in order.

In this example, the playbook has four phases: **Identification**, **Containment**, **Eradication** and **Recovery**. Each phase has a list of tasks to be performed in order. The user can add comments to the tasks and mark them as completed.

### Worklog

The worklog is a log of the actions performed by every user who worked on the incident. Any change to it will be registered and can be filtered and shown here. Additionally, any user can add comments manually to the worklog as necessary.

#### Searching in the worklog

**Logs** can be filtered by **Type** and **User**, and ordered by date. There are three kinds of logs:
* Incident changes: These logs are automatically generated by the system when the state of the incident changes, such as when the status changes or when the user does.
* Response logs: These are manually added by the user during the investigation and response process.
* Notes: Additionally, the user can add notes manually to the worklog. Useful when the detailed information doesn't fit in the rest of the types.

#### Adding notes
Additionally, the user can add notes to the worklog. By clicking on **Add Note** the text editor will appear to add the note. The note will be added to the worklog after clicking on **Save**. The text editor has useful features such as:
* Insert links 
* Insert code blocks and other formatted text
* Attach files
* Among other options

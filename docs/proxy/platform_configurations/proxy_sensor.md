# Proxy Sensor

## INTRO

A Proxy sensor will represent the device that exports the configured type of information from an external location to the manager's own location.

## Identifying the Proxy Sensor

The sensor must be claimed in the manager to start retransmitting data from the proxy. To do this, go to the Sensors section on the website. In the list of sensors, you should see a section called Unclaimed.

This menu can be expanded by clicking on it, and you will see the sensors pending to be claimed by the manager.

Proxy Unclaimed

The **globe** icon indicates that it has been identified as a proxy. If you have just completed the installation process, you can be certain that the IP displayed on the website is the same as the management interface.

!!! info "Keep in mind..."
    The IP shown on the proxy sensor corresponds to the management interface.

## Claiming the Proxy Sensor

The proxy is identified with a unique hexadecimal character identifier. This serves as a link to claim the sensor. Let's select the identifier:

``` bash title="Print the setup logs"
journalctl -u rb-register -f
```

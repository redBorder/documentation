# Installation of Proxy with RedBorder Live Registration

## Requirements

The RedBorder client proxy is software that has minimum requirements to function correctly. The essential minimum elements required for installation, as well as those recommended for adequate performance, are shown in the following table:

**Installation Requirements**
=== "Minimum"
    * Disk: 16 GB
    * RAM: 1 GB
    * CPU: 1 núcleo
    * Network Interfaces: At least two

=== "Recommended"
    * Disk: 32 GB
    * RAM: 8 GB
    * CPU: 4 núcleo
    * Network Interfaces: At least two

## Installation Process

The first step to start monitoring your network with RedBorder is to obtain the latest official RedBorder packages for Rocky Linux 9, available at [repo.redborder.com](https://repo.redborder.com).

## Installing the RPM

``` bash title="Latest"
dnf install epel-release -y && rpm -ivh https://repo.redborder.com/ng/24.11/rhel/9/x86_64/redborder-repo-24.11-0.0.1-1.el9.rb.noarch.rpm
```

``` bash title="Proxy"
dnf install redborder-proxy -y
```

With the packages downloaded and installed, the next step is to configure RedBorder. To do this, log out of the console session and log back in. You can use a basic command for this:

``` bash title="Relogin"
/bin/bash --login
```

This will update the paths to the scripts, allowing us to execute the setup command:

``` bash title="Launching the setup wizard"
rb_setup_wizard
```

This will start the platform's **setup wizard** in the console to guide you through the entire process.

## Setup Wizard

Having started the **setup wizard** for the platform in the console, you can use it as a guide throughout the process. The first screen that appears also offers an index of the upcoming steps.

Starting the wizard

If you are unsure about the current configuration, you can cancel with the "No" option, which will show the following screen before returning to the console view.

Cancelling the wizard

!!! warning "Cancellation..."
    The "No" option will cancel the entire installation process, meaning that all configuration done during the process will be lost.

### Network Configuration

This step is optional. If you are sure that the network interfaces are already configured, you can skip this step. Otherwise, enter the configuration by pressing "Yes".

![Starting network configuration](../../manager/redborder_basics/images/ch02_start_network_conf.png)

Starting network configuration

In the lower box, the existing network interfaces on the device in question are listed. Below all the interfaces that the device has, there is the `Finalize` option, which we can select **after successfully configuring** the interfaces.

Network configuration

By selecting an interface and entering it, we are given the option to configure it with a static IP address or to operate dynamically (with DHCP).

![Network interface configuration](../../manager/redborder_basics/images/ch02_img002.png)

Network interface configuration

If you select the static IP option, you will need to specify the IP, subnet mask, and default gateway:

Static interface configuration

## Select management interface

Because the proxy has at least two interfaces, you have to select which one is the management one.

### DNS configuration

The setup wizard will give you the option to choose whether or not to configure DNS servers if you actually need to configure a DNS.

![Starting DNS Configuration](../../manager/redborder_basics/images/ch02_start_dns.png)

Starting DNS configuration

If you need to configure DNS, set up at least one server. This can be done on the following screen:

![DNS Configuration](../../manager/redborder_basics/images/ch02_img004.png)

DNS configuration

### Configuration with the Remote Server

The proxy will be associated with a manager or cluster with which to share the captured data. To associate, you need to indicate the address of the manager or cluster. You can indicate either a domain address or an IP address.

### Finishing the Configuration

Before applying the configuration, the wizard will summarize all the filled-in information, waiting for the user to accept it.

Accept configuration

### Finishing the Installation

The installation is almost complete; you just have to wait for the process to finish.

Applying Configuration

Press "OK" to return to the console view.

Additionally, you can observe the logs of the registration process with the manager using the following command:
``` bash title="Print the setup logs"
journalctl -u rb-bootstrap -f
```

At the end of the installation process, the journal will show the following:

End of installation

## What's Next?

In the next chapter, we will finish associating the proxy with the manager so that it can retransmit data.

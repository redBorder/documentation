# Incidents

Incidents are the main entry point of the RedBorder platform. They are the result of the analysis of the events and alerts generated by the system waiting to be reviewed by the user, either to be reported or dismissed.

## Parts of the view

You can see the different parts of the view in the previous image:
* A search bar to find an incident.
* A filter bar to filter the incidents.
* The list of incidents.

By default, no filter is applied and the list is ordered by date from most recent to oldest.

## Fields of an incident

The fields of an incident are the following:

* ID: Unique identifier of the incident.
* Priority: The priority of the incident to be managed.
* Name: An explanatory name of the incident.
* Source: The datasource from which the incident was generated.
* Created at: The date and time when the incident was detected.
* Assigned: The user of the web that currently has the incident assigned.

## Actions on an incident

The actions that can be performed on an incident are the following:
* Click on the name of the incident to see the details of the incident.
* Click on the source of the incident to go to the view of the source of the incident.
* Click on status to change the status of the incident.
* Click on the settings icon to start managing the incident.
* Click on trash icon to delete the incident.

Clicking on the name of the incident will show the details of the incident, expanding the explanation of it. Clicking on **View Incident Detail** will have the same effect as clicking on the settings icon. In both cases, if the incident's status was **New**, it will change to **Open**; and the user will be assigned to yourself.

### Response

The response section displays a **playbook**, which is a structured guide for handling the incident. A playbook provides a systematic approach to incident response, ensuring that all necessary steps are followed in a consistent manner. There are different types of playbooks, which are defined by the type of incident. The playbook is divided by phases. Each phase can have different tasks to be performed, and each task have a description of it and a specific space for writing the comments of response process. Phases and tasks are suppoused to be executed in order.

In this example, the playbook has four phases: **Identification**, **Containment**, **Eradication** and **Recovery**. Each chapter has a list of tasks to be performed in order. The user can add comments to the tasks and mark them as completed.

### Worklog

The worklog is a log of the actions performed by every user who worked on the incident. Any change to it will be registered and can be filtered and shown here. Additionally, any user can add comments manually to the worklog as necessary.

#### Searching in the worklog

**Logs** can be filtered by **Type** and **User**, and ordered by date. There are three kinds of logs:
* Incident changes: These logs are automatically generated by the system when the state of the incident changes, such as when the status changes or when the user does.
* Response logs: These are manually added by the user during the investigation and response process.
* Notes: Additionally, the user can add notes manually to the worklog. Useful when the detailed information doesn't fit in the rest of the types.

#### Adding notes
Additionally, the user can add notes to the worklog. By clicking on **Add Note** the text editor will appear to add the note. The note will be added to the worklog after clicking on **Save**. The text editor has useful features such as:
* Insert links 
* Insert code blocks and other formatted text
* Attach files
* Among other options

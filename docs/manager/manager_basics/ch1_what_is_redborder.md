# What is Redborder Manager?

The platform unifies the different data sources provided by applications and probes. Additionally, it includes a set of common features: customizable panels and reports, correlation, analysis engines, user management, and layered storage.

Applications are within the platform and can be installed as plugins. These focus on digesting new types of data.

Probes are located outside the platform but are managed from it, and their function is to create new types of data and inspection capabilities.

Depending on the applications integrated into the platform, the user will see different options in the menu bar. The applications available in this new version of Redborder are as follows:

- Business Intelligence
<!-- - Malware -->
- Traffic
- Intrusion
- Monitor
- Vault
- Mobility
- Reports

Additionally, Redborder now includes an **anomaly detection system powered by artificial intelligence**, which will be constantly learning about trends and normal data behavior in the different applications of the platform.

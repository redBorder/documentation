# Menu and Module Options

In the analysis area of the menu bar (top bar, left margin), we can find different sections corresponding to the Apps we have integrated into the RedBorder platform.

Later on, we will explore the different options for data visualization, types of charts, granularity (maximum degree of temporal detail for an event query), and attributes that can be combined to obtain a fully customizable network traffic visualizer.

### Aggregation

There are different values or units of measure in which the data can be displayed. For example, flows per second (flows/s) or bytes per second (bps). Note that each module has its own aggregation options.

If you want to see the available aggregations, expand this tab:

??? info "Available Aggregations"

    | Aggregation        | Description                            |
    | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |

    !!! tip "Recommendation..."
    
        Optimize your metric by combining different types of aggregation granularity options (time periods) that are available.

![Aggregation](images/ch04_img014.png)

Aggregation

### Granularity

Indicates the degree of temporal detail that can be shown in the information. The minimum value for granularity is one minute.

Granularity options vary depending on the time range displayed (1h, 2h, Last week, Last month, etc.). With this view, the user can analyze network traffic in real-time.

Depending on the selected time period, the user can understand traffic details, for example, over a two-minute interval.

![Granularity](images/ch04_img015.png)

Granularity

### Chart

Displays the different types of graphs among which the data can be shown. The available graph types vary depending on the selected view. This option does not appear, for example, when applying the map view of the data, as the data is represented on that map.

These are the graphical possibilities of the Redborder platform for views:

**Area**: graph that overlays the data on a group of elements belonging to the selected attribute, making the total traffic the sum of the traffic per attribute.

![Chart Type: Area](images/ch04_img016.png)

Chart Type: Area

To display a single graphical element, simply click on its drawn graph to isolate it.

**Lines**: graph that overlays the data on a group of elements belonging to the selected attribute; in this case, the area is not shown but the graph is represented by a line.

![Chart Type: Lines](images/ch04_img017.png)

Chart Type: Lines

**Bars**: overlays data on a group of elements belonging to the selected attribute, with the total being the sum of values for each of those elements. In this case, the data is represented by bars.

![Chart Type: Bars](images/ch04_img018.png)

Chart Type: Bars

**Stacked Bars**: provides in the same graph the data obtained for each of the elements included in the selected attribute, so you can see the results of independent IP, sensor, etc., represented in bars.

![Chart Type: Stacked Bars](images/ch04_img019.png)

Chart Type: Stacked Bars

**Accumulated**: comparatively shows the data for each of the selected attributes in the same graph.

![Chart Type: Accumulated](images/ch04_img020.png)

Chart Type: Accumulated

**Flows**: graph only available in Raw view. Shows traffic flow by sensor.

![Graph Type: Flows](images/ch06_img001.png)

Graph Type: Flows

### Options

In this section, the user can perform various actions to manage the data being displayed. The options vary depending on the selected view.

- *Show total/Hide total*: when selecting this option, the value of all differentiated traffic received or transmitted by each of the attributes that can be queried is displayed on the graph. When this option is active, the list of "Hide total" options appears. Available in the upper and unique view.
- *Export to CSV*: provides the option to export to CSV including the data corresponding to the selected attribute, you can set a row limit to include in the file. Only available for **Tops and Unique views**.
- *Time machine*: returns the machine to a previous state. By selecting this option, the user can see the data as if they were viewing it on the last specified day and time. Available for all views except Raw.
- *Sort aggregations*: allows changing the order of the aggregations displayed in the module.
- *Sort columns*: **available for Raw view**. Allows changing the order of the columns displayed in the module.
- *Save tabs/columns as default*: by selecting this option, the currently open tabs will be saved as the default tabs.
- *Start Reloading*: **available for Raw view**. Activates the countdown for data reload; on the left of the section bar, a countdown appears indicating the time to reload. At any time, this can be stopped by selecting *Stop Reloading*.

### Attributes

Events received by the Manager consist of a "column: value" pair. The values given in each column can be understood as specific event data that actually provide information. These are called "attributes".

These attributes help us carry out a comprehensive and customized analysis for each of the elements involved in the flow of network traffic in our organization. These are organized into tabs or columns in the view we are consulting. The options shown are common for all views, except for the Compare case (offers only comparability by weeks or months) and Maps, in which case this section is not shown.

If you want to see the available attribute categories, expand this tab:

??? info "Available Attribute Categories"

    === "General Categories"

        - Application
        - Client Data
        - Blacklist
        - Data Link
        - Flow
        - Interface
        - Location
        - Network
        - Transport
        - UUIDs

    === "Malware Categories"

        - Email
        - File
        - Malware
        - Network

![Attributes](images/ch04_img022.png)

Attributes

All attributes have specific meaning and functionality. For example, in the Traffic module, we can observe highly relevant attributes such as *Public IP*, which shows the real IP address of devices on the network, *Public IP MAP*, indicating their position on the map, or *Country Code*, which indicates the country they belong to.

### Time Filtering

Located to the left, a bit below the submenu, are shortcuts to filtered events based on time periods. The periods defined in the platform are Last Hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and Last Week.

![Time Period Filters](images/ch04_img024.png)

Time Period Filters

There is the possibility to select a different time period than the default one offered. Depending on the user's needs, a custom selection of the period can be made using the Custom option. The procedure to perform a custom time filter is specified later.

### Attribute Tabs

Classified information of network traffic by attributes. By browsing through each of the tabs, detailed values associated with the selected attributes can be explored.

![Attribute Tabs](images/ch04_img025.png)

Attribute Tabs

!!! info "Keep in mind..."
    The user can change the order in which the tabs are displayed at any time. To do this, simply drag and drop the tab to the desired position.

    This part of the body is not shown in the Raw view.

### View

In this area, the data is displayed according to the selected view and chart type. Placing the mouse over any of the points that make up the chart, a dialog box displays detailed information for that moment in time, aggregation, and attribute.

![View](images/ch04_img026.png)

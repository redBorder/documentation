# Reports

The **Reports** module allows the user to create periodic reports with the information provided by the Redborder platform.

To create a new report, click on the *New Report* button and fill in all required fields. You also have the option to import a report from a file using the *Import Report* button. At the same time, next to it you have a button to view the complete history of all reports you have access to.

To search for reports, enter part of the report name or description in the search bar and press the "Enter" or "Enter" key. In addition, you can sort the reports by clicking on the column header of the column by which you want to sort; the reports will be sorted alternately in descending or ascending order.

In the report list, you can view the report history, edit an existing report, generate a PDF or send it by e-mail. All these options are available from the edit button on the right side of the list.

During the creation of a new report, you can select parameters such as schedule type, share with specific users or share with domains. Once the report is created, it will appear in the list of reports mentioned above.

In the composition view, the user can edit the report and add new widgets by pressing the *Add Block* button. If we grab the widget from the title bar at the top, we will be able to move it. In the lower right corner of each widget, the cursor will change shape, allowing you to change the size of the widget.

When generating a report, a new window will open in which, after a few seconds of loading, the report will be rendered in PDF format. The user will be able to download the report by pressing the *Print* icon ![Report printing](images/ch04_img055.png) located at the top right of the screen.

## Report history

Each time a PDF report is generated, this action will be recorded in the report history, including the time and date of generation, the report generated and the user who generated it.
The user also has the possibility to view the reports that have been previously exported, either by himself or by other users.

In this section you have at your disposal all the PDF records generated from the reports to which you have access. You can sort the history by clicking on the column names and search for generated report records. You can also view the generated PDF by clicking on the corresponding button. Users with the administrator role have the possibility to delete generated report records.
